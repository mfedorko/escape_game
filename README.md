## Instructions

To get you started you can simply clone the `ionic_1x_seed` repository and install the dependencies

### Clone `ionic_1x_seed`

Clone the `ionic_1x_seed` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/iamntg/ionic_1x_seed.git
cd ionic_1x_seed
```

### Install Dependencies

You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.
in the ionic_1x_seed root folder, run the cmd:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
gulp serve
```

Now browse to the app at [`http://localhost:3000`][local-app-url]


If you want to generate the development build, then:

```
gulp build
```


If you want to generate the release build with minified version, then:

```
gulp release
```

During development, you can watch the repository to prevent manual build generation using:

```
gulp watch
```

This will generate the build automatially everytime you make a change in the files inside src folder
